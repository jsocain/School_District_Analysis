# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
My task was to aggregate standardized test scores and student funding data and show trends in school performance.

While conducting the analysis, evidence of academic dishonesty was discovered; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. I was asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. I was asked to repeat the school district analysis and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results
- The school district summary was not affected by removing the Thomas High School 9th grade scores. 
- The school summary was not affected by removing the Thomas High School 9th grade scores. 
- Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores did not affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools.
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- There was no affect in the math and reading scores by grade
- There was no affect in the Scores by school spending
- There was no affect in the Scores by school size
- There was no affect in the Scores by school type
